# Daps2Docker

Create HTML and PDF output of documents in a DAPS-compatible DocBook or
ASCIIDoc documentation repository. This script uses Docker (default) or Podman
to save you the hassles of setting up a documentation toolchain.

Daps2Docker works on all Linux distributions that include systemd.

## Installation

1. Install either the Docker container engine (recommended) or the Podman container engine package for your distribution.

   For Docker engine (recommended):
   *  OpenSUSE/SLES: `sudo zypper install docker`
   *  Fedora/RHEL: `sudo dnf install docker`
   *  Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt install docker.io`

   For Podman engine:
   *  The minimum required version is `1.1.0`.
      On openSUSE Leap 15.1, use the `podman` version from the OBS project
      `devel:kubic`. On openSUSE Tumbleweed, use the default version of `podman`.
      For more installation advice, see the [official documentation](https://github.com/containers/libpod/blob/master/install.md).


2. Choose whether to install from the repository or as a package:
   * For openSUSE/SLE, there is a package available at: https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/Documentation:Tools/daps2docker
   * Alternatively, clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/openSUSE/daps2docker`


### First-Run Prerequisites

On the first run, Docker or Podman needs to download a container
with an installation of DAPS on openSUSE Leap.

This means, you need:

*  Make sure you have at least 1.5 GB of space on your root partition left
*  Make sure you have internet access


### Creating Output Documents

1. Clone a DAPS-compatible documentation repository.
2. The `DC-` files in the documentation repository correspond to documents.
   Check which `DC-` files you want to build.
3. *(optional)* By default, `daps2docker` uses `docker` as its container engine.
   To use `podman`, export the environment variable `CONTAINER_ENGINE=podman`:
   ```console
   $ export CONTAINER_ENGINE=podman
   ```
4. Run the script from the cloned script repository. You can choose between two
   modes:
   *  To build all DC files: `./daps2docker.sh /PATH/TO/DOC-DIR`
   *  To build a single DC file: `./daps2docker.sh /PATH/TO/DC-FILE`
   By default, the script will create PDF and HTML output, but there are
   more formats available: See the output of `./daps2docker.sh --help`.
5. You may have to enter the `root` password.
   *  If you are using the Docker engine, this allows starting the Docker
      service. It also allows starting/stopping containers when your user
      account is not part of the `docker` group.
   *  If you are using Podman, this allows starting/stopping containers.
      (Rootless Podman is currently not supported.)

When it is done, the script will tell you where it copied the output documents.
Take a look!
